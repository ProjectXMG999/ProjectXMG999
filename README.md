###  About Me :

I am a Junior Data Scientist from Poland / Poznan City

I have strong background in machine learning, and a passion for exploring the possibilities of artificial intelligence. From the new academic year, I am starting part-time studies in the field of data science. Although I have no professional experience on this postion(AI enginer/ Data scientist), I have gained extensive knowledge and hands-on experience through my coursework and personal projects.

I am well-versed in a range of machine learning techniques, including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision and deep learning. I have experience working with various NLP models such as Transformers, Memory Networks, Attention, BERT, and GPT. In the field of computer vision, I have worked with object detection frameworks like YOLOv5, R-CNNs, Detectron2, and SSDs. Additionally, I have a strong understanding of neural networks, including e.x CNNs, RNNs, GRUs, LSTMs, and RBFs.

I am also proficient in various Python libraries, including Numpy, Pandas, Data visualization with seaborn and matplotlib, Web Scrapping with selenium and BeautifulSoup, Tensorflow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, and Keras. I have also knowledge of Azure Platform, especially in the field of Data science and AI

My personal projects have given me the opportunity to work with real-world datasets and develop my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and optimization. I have also honed my problem-solving skills and developed a strong ability to work independently and collaboratively.
